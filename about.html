            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I was born in the mountainous and picturesque Aosta Valley, where I grew up exploring nature through hiking, enjoying swimming, and pursuing my studies at a scientific high school. My passion for science led me to Turin, where I pursued a Bachelor's degree in Physics and later a Master's in Physics of Complex Systems. During this time, I had the opportunity to spend a semester in Vienna (how beautiful is Vienna, and how delicious is the Sacher cake?) to work on my master’s thesis at the Central European University.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I work as an AI Specialist in Savona, a charming seaside town that constantly feels like a vacation for someone born among the mountains. My work focuses on harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to solve complex problems, blending my love for science, technology, and creative problem-solving.
            </p>

            <h2>My Background</h2>
            <p>
                My academic journey has been centered around understanding and modeling complex systems. From statistical physics to machine learning, I've always been drawn to patterns and structures that define our world. After completing my Master’s, I transitioned into the field of AI, where I continue to explore how technology can enhance human creativity and solve complex challenges.
            </p>

            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>
                Beyond work, I enjoy immersing myself in nature, whether it's hiking in the mountains or exploring the coastline. I also enjoy writing short stories, playing board games, and watching sci-fi movies for entertainment and (maybe) inspiration.
            </p>
