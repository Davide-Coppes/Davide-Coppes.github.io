                description: "The 'Quantization in Depth' course provides advanced training on model quantization methods to reduce model sizes while maintaining performance. Participants will implement and customize linear quantization, including symmetric and asymmetric modes, and various granularities. They will build a general-purpose quantizer in PyTorch to compress model weights from 32 bits to 8 bits and even 2 bits. This course is ideal for those with prior knowledge of quantization fundamentals and experience with PyTorch.",
