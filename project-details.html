                description: "This project aims to determine whether and how a network has been attacked using machine learning techniques. The networks under consideration are of three types: Erdős–Rényi, Barabási–Albert, and Watts–Strogatz. We characterize each network using four metrics: Normalized Reciprocal Maximum Degree, Global Clustering Coefficient, Normalized Average Path Length, and Assortativity. The types of attacks analyzed include Random Failures, Maximum-Degree Node Deletion, and Maximum-Betweenness Node Deletion. For node deletion, nodes are removed based on their centrality in the network, measured by degree and betweenness. We employ two machine learning models to identify whether a network has been attacked and, if so, determine the type of attack: Random Forest Algorithm and Feedforward Neural Network.",
